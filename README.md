# google-homepage

This is the first project among the many in odin project's website. I shall be demonstarting my HTML5 and CSS3 skills in this particular project.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

AIM
--------
The main aim would be to mimic the google's search page, even if the functionality is not there yet.

-> Now there's an easy version and a difficult version available. I shall try working on both of these.

THE EASY VERSION (to build the google.com homepage)
--------------
1. To start with, I saved a few images and caputred a few (usin screen capture tool) into my images folder.
2. I began and completed the initial html markup.
3. Included the very basic CSS for all elements (header, content, footer) in the webpage
4. Finally I included the last finishing touches in the CSS

THE DIFFICULT VERSION (to build the search results page of Google)
---------------
1. I linked this new html with the old one. To visit the difficult version, one must simply click on the user profile image.
2. I completed the HTML markup for this page as well.
3. Finally after finishing the css for the header, content and the footer, my webpage is ready.
4. This entire project should've been done in 1-2 days but fueled with procrastination it took me 5 days.
