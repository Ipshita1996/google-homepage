This is the first project among the many in odin project's website. I shall be demonstarting my HTML5 and CSS3 skills in this particular project.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

AIM
--------
The main aim would be to mimic the google's search page, even if the functionality is not there yet.

-> Now there's an easy version and a difficult version available. I shall try working on both of these.

THE EASY VERSION (to build the google.com homepage)
1. To start with, I saved a few images and caputred a few (usin screen capture tool) into my images folder.
2. I began and completed the initial html markup.
